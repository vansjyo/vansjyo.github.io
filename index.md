I am a second year graduate student at University Of Illinois Urbana-Champaign focussing broadly on problems in Operations Research. I am currently working on fair division in Algorthmic Game Theory, advised by prof Rakesh Nagi and Prof Jugal Garg.

Apart from Operations Research and Algorithm Development, I am interested in Quantitative Finance and markets.

I have research experience in Data Mining, Computer Vision/Image Processing and Machine/Deep Learning. During my undergard, I did some Web Development in NodeJS/React as well.
